// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  

var a = prompt("Please enter first number");
var b = prompt("Please enter second number");
var sum = Number(a) + Number(b);
alert("The sum of both numbers is: " + sum);
or
var a = prompt("Please enter first number");
var b = prompt("Please enter second number");
alert("The sum of both numbers is: " + (Number(a) + Number(b)));




// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
var a = prompt("Please enter first number");
var b = prompt("Please enter second number");
var difference = Number(a) - Number(b);
alert("The difference between both numbers is: " + difference);

var a = prompt("Please enter first number");
var b = prompt("Please enter second number");
var product = Number(a) * Number(b);
alert("The product of both numbers is: " + product);

var a = prompt("Please enter first number");
var b = prompt("Please enter second number");
var divide = Number(a) / Number(b);
alert("The division of both numbers is: " + divide);
